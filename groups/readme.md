Properties 
- Electronegativity (Data)
  - The `C` = 2.5 
  - The `O` = 3.5 
- Comments 
  - The `O` attracts most of the electrons hence 
    - The `C` has some local excess of positive charge hence it is electrophile (i.e. attracts electrons)
    - The `O` has some local excess of negative charge hence it is nucleophile (i.e. attracts nucleus)
