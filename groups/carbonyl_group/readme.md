# Overview 

The Carbonyl Group is characterized by a `C` with double bond to `O` and 2 radicals

Properties 
- General Properties 
  - Electronegativity (Data)
    - The `C` = 2.5 
    - The `O` = 3.5 
- Specific Properties 
  - Hybridation 
    - The `C` is `sp2` hybridated 
- Comments 
  - The `O` attracts most of the electrons hence 
    - The `C` has some local excess of positive charge hence it is electrophile (i.e. attracts electrons)
    - The `O` has some local excess of negative charge hence it is nucleophile (i.e. attracts nucleus)

# Reactions 

## Nucleophilic Addition 

Algo 
- Start
  - The `C` is electrophilic due to local positive charge imbalance 
- Nucleaus Addition 
  - Attraction 
    - A negative charged nucleus is attracted by the `C` 
  - Hybridation switch 
    - The `C` changes from `sp2` to `sp3` hybridation hence breaking the `O` double bond 
    - The `O` is then left with a non shared electron 
- Oxygen fixing 
  - The `O` attracts a free `H+` to share its electron 
    - **Note** This reason is then favoured in Acid Environment
